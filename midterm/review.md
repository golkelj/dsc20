## HOF 
function()() 
- First () is the outer function and the second () 
is the inner function
- does stuff from left to right

- if you do not add the parameters to a function you can accomplish it by call () outside

- if the inner function is defined within the outer function you must called it with 
function()() 

- if the function is defined on the outside you do not need to call it 

``` range() ```
- range(start, stop, step)
    - start: inclusive
    - stop: exclusive
    - step: jump

``` print() ```
- print: returns none
- the inner statement will excute first
    - so if you print(print(__)) it will print the __ then it will return none
